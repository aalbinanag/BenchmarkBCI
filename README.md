# BenchmarkBCI
Build a benchmark of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) algorithms applied on freely available EEG datasets.

The goal of the project is to compare the different state-of-the-art classifiers for designing BCIs and establish a benchmark in terms of classification accuracy subject to the datasets and hence, draw inspiration from them in order to design new and better performing BCIs.
